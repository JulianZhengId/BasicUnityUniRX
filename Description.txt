This app is made with Unity.
In this app, you can create a Base(cube) for a building.

When you click on the Base, you can see there is an outline applied on the Base
That means the current selected object is that cube.
You can configure the Base (move, rotate, resize, texture).
You can drag on the phone screen to do the configuration.

Moreover, This app has 
- some buttons like Undo, Copy, Delete, Deselect.
- Slider for zoom in and zoom out.
But there is still no merge button in this game to merge buildings together.

Building's Attributes are also provided for the selected Base.
e.g : Position, Size, etc.
